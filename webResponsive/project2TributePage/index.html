          <li class="info">
            <strong class="">1914</strong> - Born in Cresco, Iowa
          </li>
          <li class="info">
            <strong class="">1933</strong> - Leaves his family's farm to attend
            the University of Minnesota, thanks to a Depression era program
            known as the "National Youth Administration"
          </li>
          <li class="info">
            <strong class="">1935</strong> - Has to stop school and save up more
            money. Works in the Civilian Conservation Corps, helping starving
            Americans. "I saw how food changed them", he said. "All of this left
            scars on me."

          <li class="info">
            <strong class="">1937</strong> - Finishes university and takes a job
            in the US Forestry Service
          </li>
          <li class="info">
            <strong class="">1938</strong> - Marries wife of 69 years Margret
            Gibson. Gets laid off due to budget cuts. Inspired by Elvin Charles
            Stakman, he returns to school study under Stakman, who teaches him
            about breeding pest-resistent plants.
          </li>
          <li class="info">
            <strong class="">1941</strong> - Tries to enroll in the military
            after the Pearl Harbor attack, but is rejected. Instead, the
            military asked his lab to work on waterproof glue, DDT to control
            malaria, disinfectants, and other applied science.
          </li>
          <li class="info">
            <strong class="">1942</strong> - Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and
            Plant Pathology

          <li class="info">
            <strong class="">1944</strong> - Rejects a 100% salary increase from
            Dupont, leaves behind his pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to head
            a new plant pathology program. Over the next 16 years, his team
            breeds 6,000 different strains of disease resistent wheat -
            including different varieties for each major climate on Earth.
          </li>
          <li class="info">
            <strong class="">1945</strong> - Discovers a way to grown wheat
            twice each season, doubling wheat yields
          </li>
          <li class="info">
            <strong class="">1953</strong> - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed
            of wheat with a high-yeidling American breed, creating a strain that
            responds well to fertilizer. It goes on to provide 95% of Mexico's
            wheat.
          </li>
          <li class="info">
            <strong class="">1962</strong> - Visits Delhi and brings his
            high-yielding strains of wheat to the Indian subcontinent in time to
            help mitigate mass starvation due to a rapidly expanding population

          <li class="info">
            <strong class="">1984</strong> - becomes a distinguished professor
            at Texas A&amp;M University
          </li>
          <li class="info">
            <strong class="">2005</strong> - states "we will have to double the
            world food supply by 2050." Argues that genetically modified crops
            are the only way we can meet the demand, as we run out of arable
            land. Says that GM crops are not inherently dangerous because "we've
            been genetically modifying plants and animals for a long time. Long
            before we called it science, people were selecting the best breeds."
          </li>
          <li class="info">
            <strong class="">2009</strong> - dies at the age of 95.
